# Eclipse Complete Current Statement

One of the main features in IntelliJ that I miss in Eclipse is complete current statement shortcut,
which adds either semicolon or curly brackets at the end of the line. This plugin tries
to shamelessly mock it. As it's just regex comparison, it's nowhere near the level IJ is,
but beats nothing.

Default shortcut is *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*, under keybindings search for _Try to complete line_

To install, either build on your own or use [CompleteLine-update-site.zip](https://github.com/henri5/completeline/raw/master/CompleteLine-update-site.zip) as update site.
