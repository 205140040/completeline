# Eclipse Complete Current Statement

One of the main features Eclipse is missing is complete current statement shortcut, which adds 
either semicolon or curly brackets (braces?) at the end of the line, similar to the one in IntelliJ. This 
plugin tries to shamelessly mock it. As it's just regex comparison, it's nowhere near the level 
IJ is, but beats nothing.

Default shortcut is *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*, under keybindings search for _Try to complete line_
